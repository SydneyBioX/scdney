We introduce this class for analysing molecule-based spatial transcriptomics data (e.g., Xenium by 10X, Cosmx SMI by Nanostring, and Merscope by Vizgen).

The scMerge method leverages factor analysis, stably expressed genes (SEGs) and (pseudo-) replicates to remove unwanted variations and merge multiple single-cell data.

    "text": "How do I find changes in my data?\n\nClassifyR\n\nThe software formalises a framework for classification and survival model evaluation in R. There are four stages; Data transformation, feature selection, model training, and prediction. The requirements of variable types and variable order are fixed, but specialised variables for functions can also be provided. The framework is wrapped in a driver loop that reproducibly carries out a number of cross-validation schemes. Functions for differential mean, differential variability, and differential distribution are included. Additional functions may be developed by the user, by creating an interface to the framework.\n\n\nStrbenac D, Mann GJ, Ormerod JT, Yang JYH (2015). “ClassifyR: an R package for performance assessment of classification with applications to transcriptomics.” Bioinformatics, 31(11), 1851-1853.\n\n\n\n\ntreekoR\n\ntreekoR is a novel framework that aims to utilise the hierarchical nature of single cell cytometry data to find robust and interpretable associations between cell subsets and patient clinical end points. These associations are aimed to recapitulate the nested proportions prevalent in workflows inovlving manual gating, which are often overlooked in workflows using automatic clustering to identify cell populations. We developed treekoR to: Derive a hierarchical tree structure of cell clusters; quantify a cell types as a proportion relative to all cells in a sample (%total), and, as the proportion relative to a parent population (%parent); perform significance testing using the calculated proportions; and provide an interactive html visualisation to help highlight key results.\n\n\nChan A (2023). treekoR: Cytometry Cluster Hierarchy and Cellular-to-phenotype Associations. doi:10.18129/B9.bioc.treekoR, R package version 1.10.0.\n\n\n\n\nscFeatures\n\nscFeatures constructs multi-view representations of single-cell and spatial data. scFeatures is a tool that generates multi-view representations of single-cell and spatial data through the construction of a total of 17 feature types.

The functionality provided by Statial provides robust quantification of cell type localisation which are invariant to changes in tissue structure. In addition to this Statial uncovers changes in marker expression associated with varying levels of localisation. These features can be used to explore how the structure and function of different cell types may be altered by the agents they are surrounded with.\n\n\nAmeen F, Iyengar S, Ghazanfar S, Patrick E (2023).
