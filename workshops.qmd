title: "Problem-focused Workshops"
---

The Sydney Precision Data Science Centre runs several workshops that teach attendees to deal with the complexities of single cell data. These workshops target a specific challenge related to single cell data and show attendees how to address it while highlighting the nuances in each step of the process.

## Fondation workshop

The foundation workshop focuses on the basic aspect of navigating and visualising single-cell data. Additionally it covers aspects such as:

-   Quality control
-   Normalisation
-   Batch correction
-   Cell-type annotation with marker genes
-   Cell-type clustering

### Advanced extension

Additionally, the foundation workshop can be extended to include advanced topics such as:

-   Merging datasets
-   Batch effect quantification and visualisation
-   Joint cell-type annotation
-   Cell-type annotation quality control
-   Marker and pathway analysis
-   Gene regulatory network analysis

## Advanced cell phenotyping

The advanced cell phenotyping workshop guides attendees through the process for annotating cells beyond cell-type.

-   Trajectory analysis
    -   Feature selection using differential expression, differential stability.
    -   Dimension reduction and visualisation
    -   Lineage structure creation with pseudo time inference
-   Trajectory quality control
-   Trajectory characterisation
-   Cell-cell interaction

## Disease Outcome Classification in Single Cell Data

The disease outcome classification guides attendee through using single cell data to classify disease outcome.

-   Generating features from single cell data
-   Feature quality control
-   Multi-view classification
-   Model robustness
