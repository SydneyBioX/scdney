title: "Problem-focused Workshops"
---

The Sydney Precision Data Science Centre has developed a series of living workshops for building data stories, using single-cell data integrative analysis (SCDNEY). Through these workshops, we not only showcase current solutions, but also highlight critical thinking points. In particular, we highlight the Thinking Process Template that provides a structured framework for the decision-making process behind such single-cell analyses. Furthermore, our workshop will incorporate dynamic contributions from the community in a collaborative learning approach, thus the term 'living'. For more information on the Thinking Process Template, please see our F1000 publication (https://f1000research.com/articles/12-261)

## [Advanced cell phenotyping](https://sydneybiox.github.io/scdneyAdvancedPhenotyping/articles/advanced_phenotyping.html)

The advanced cell phenotyping workshop guides attendees through the challenge of annotating cells beyond cell-type.


#### Learning Objectives

- Describe various strategies for cellular phenotyping
- Identify different workflows to build trajectory including calculate pseudo-times
- Generate appropriate graphics to visualise the trajectories and expression of genes
- Understand the different trajectory characterisation approaches including differentially expressed genes across trajectories, 
- Evaluate the single cell data to identify genes that distinguish trajectories and ligand-receptor interactions that distinguish cell types
- [Optional] Identify cell-cell interactions in a single cell data and understand how cell-cell communication can be used to distinguish cell types

## [Disease Outcome Classification in Single Cell Data](https://sydneybiox.github.io/scdneyDiseasePrediction/articles/disease_outcome_classification_schulte.html)

The disease outcome classification guides attendee through using single cell data to classify disease outcome.

#### Learning Objectives

- Explore various strategies for disease outcome prediction using single cell data     
- Understand the transformation from cell level features to patient level features     
- Generate patient representations from gene expression matrix      
- Understand the characteristics of good classification models   
- Perform disease outcome prediction using the feature representation and robust classification framework
