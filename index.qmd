## Welcome! 

Scientists now have the ability to generate a vast amount of high throughput biomedical data, which can carry critical information for important clinical and public health applications. This data revolution in biology is now generating a multitude of new single-cell datasets. Concurrently, there have been significant methodological advances in single-cell research. Integrating these two resources, creating tailor-made, efficient, and purpose-specific data analysis approaches can assist in accelerating scientific discovery.
