	abstract = {There is accumulating evidence that patients with functional neurological symptom disorder (FND) show activation of multiple components of the stress system-the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, autonomic nervous system, and brain regions involved in arousal- and emotion-processing. This study aims to examine whether the immune-inflammatory component of the stress system is also activated. C-reactive protein (CRP) blood titre levels were measured in 79 children and adolescents with FND. CRP values ≥ 2 mg/L suggest low-grade inflammation. CRP values {\textbackslash}textgreater 10 mg/L suggest a disease process. Sixty-six percent of subjects (n = 52) had CRP titres ≥ 2 mg/L. The upward shift in the distribution of CRP levels suggested low-grade inflammation (median CRP concentration was 4.60 mg/L, with 75th and 90th percentiles of 6.1 and 10.3 mg/L, respectively). Elevated CRP titres were not explained by sex, pubertal status, BMI, or medical factors. Confounder analyses suggested that history of maltreatment (χ2 = 2.802, df = 1, p = 0.094, φ = 0.190; β = 2.823, p = 0.04) and a diagnosis of anxiety (χ2 = 2.731, df = 1, p = 0.098, φ = 0.187; β = 4.520, p = 0.061) contributed to elevated CRP levels. Future research will need to identify the origins and locations of immune cell activation and the pathways and systems contributing to their activation and modulation. Because functional activity in neurons and glial cells-the brain's innate effector immune cells-is tightly coupled, our finding of elevated CRP titres suggests activation of the immune-inflammatory component of the brain's stress system. A more direct examination of inflammation-related molecules in the brain will help clarify the role of immune-inflammatory processes in FND.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The role of the innate immune system in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and neurodegenerative disease susceptibility has recently been highlighted in genetic studies. However, we do not know whether risk for inflammatory disease predisposes unaffected individuals to late-life cognitive deficits or AD-related neuropathology. We investigated whether genetic risk scores for seven immune diseases and central nervous system traits were related to cognitive decline (nmax = 1601), classical AD neuropathology (nmax = 985), or microglial density (nmax = 184). METHODS: Longitudinal cognitive decline, postmortem amyloid and tau neuropathology, microglial density, and gene module expression from bulk brain tissue were all measured in participants from two large cohorts (the Rush Religious Orders Study and Memory and Aging Project; ROS/MAP) of elderly subjects (mean age at entry 78 +/- 8.7 years). We analyzed data primarily using robust regression methods. Neuropathologists were blind to clinical data. RESULTS: The AD genetic risk scores, including and excluding APOE effects, were strongly associated with cognitive decline in all domains (min Puncor = 3.2 × 10- 29). Multiple sclerosis (MS), Parkinson's disease, and schizophrenia risk did not influence cognitive decline in older age, but the rheumatoid arthritis (RA) risk score alone was significantly associated with microglial density after correction (t146 = - 3.88, Puncor = 1.6 × 10- 4). Post-hoc tests found significant effects of the RA genetic risk score in multiple regions and stages of microglial activation (min Puncor = 1.5 × 10- 6). However, these associations were driven by only one or two variants, rather than cumulative polygenicity. Further, individual MS (Pone-sided {\textbackslash}textless 8.4 × 10- 4) and RA (Pone-sided = 3 × 10- 4) variants associated with higher microglial density were also associated with increased expression of brain immune gene modules. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that global risk of inflammatory disease does not strongly influence aging-related cognitive decline but that susceptibility variants that influence peripheral immune function also alter microglial density and immune gene expression in the aging brain, opening a new perspective on the control of microglial and immune responses within the central nervous system. Further study on the molecular mechanisms of peripheral immune disease risk influencing glial cell activation will be required to identify key regulators of these pathways.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Human females have a unique duration of post-reproductive longevity, during which sex-specific mechanisms ma influence later-life mechanisms of neuronal resilience and vulnerability. The maintenance of energy metabolism, through the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) apparatus, is essential for brain health. Given the known association between reproductive period (years from menarche to menopause) and cognitive aging, we examined the hypothesis that cumulative estrogen exposure across the lifetime may be associated with differential methylation of genes in the OXPHOS pathway. METHODS: Using DNA methylation patterns in the post-mortem dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) of 426 women prospectively followed until death in the Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project, we examined the relationship between reproductive period (subtracting age at menarche from age at menopause) and DNA methylation of a published set of autosomal OXPHOS genes previously implicated in stroke susceptibility. We then performed an unsupervised analysis of methylation levels across the Hallmark pathways from the Molecular Signatures Database. RESULTS: We observed a strong association between reproductive period and DNA methylation status across OXPHOS CpGs. We replicated this association between reproductive period and DNA methylation in a much larger set of OXPHOS genes in our unsupervised analysis. Here, reproductive period also showed associations with methylation in genes related to E2F, MYC and MTORC1 signaling, fatty acid metabolism and DNA repair. CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence from both a supervised and unsupervised analyses, that lifetime cumulative endogenous steroid exposures may play a role in maintenance of post-menopausal cellular balance, including in brain tissue.},

However, these efforts are hindered by the lack of understanding of what constitutes the phenotype of aged human microglia-the cell type that has been strongly implicated by genetic studies in the pathogenesis of age-related neurodegenerative disease. Here, we establish the set of genes that is preferentially expressed by microglia in the aged human brain. This HuMi\_Aged gene set captures a unique phenotype, which we confirm at the protein level. Furthermore, we find this gene set to be enriched in susceptibility genes for Alzheimer's disease and multiple sclerosis, to be increased with advancing age, and to be reduced by the protective APOEε2 haplotype. APOEε4 has no effect. These findings confirm the existence of an aging-related microglial phenotype in the aged human brain and its involvement in the pathological processes associated with brain aging.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We characterised the clinical course, treatment and outcomes in 59 patients with relapsing myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) antibody-associated demyelination. METHODS: We evaluated clinical phenotypes, annualised relapse rates (ARR) prior and on immunotherapy and Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), in 218 demyelinating episodes from 33 paediatric and 26 adult patients. RESULTS: The most common initial presentation in the cohort was optic neuritis (ON) in 54\% (bilateral (BON) 32\%, unilateral (UON) 22\%), followed by acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) (20\%), which occurred exclusively in children. ON was the dominant phenotype (UON 35\%, BON 19\%) of all clinical episodes. 109/226 (48\%) MRIs had no brain lesions. Patients were steroid responsive, but 70\% of episodes treated with oral prednisone relapsed, particularly at doses {\textbackslash}textless10 mg daily or within 2 months of cessation. Immunotherapy, including maintenance prednisone (P=0.0004), intravenous immunoglobulin, rituximab and mycophenolate, all reduced median ARRs on-treatment. Treatment failure rates were lower in patients on maintenance steroids (5\%) compared with non-steroidal maintenance immunotherapy (38\%) (P=0.016). 58\% of patients experienced residual disability (average follow-up 61 months, visual loss in 24\%). Patients with ON were less likely to have sustained disability defined by a final EDSS of ≥2 (OR 0.15, P=0.032), while those who had any myelitis were more likely to have sustained residual deficits (OR 3.56, P=0.077). CONCLUSION: Relapsing MOG antibody-associated demyelination is strongly associated with ON across all age groups and ADEM in children. Patients are highly responsive to steroids, but vulnerable to relapse on steroid reduction and cessation.},

METHODS: We report analyses of expression profiling of miRNA (n = 700 subjects) and lincRNA (n = 540 subjects) from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of individuals participating in two longitudinal cohort studies of aging. RESULTS: We confirm the association of two well-established miRNA (miR-132, miR-129) with pathologic AD in our dataset and then further characterize this association in terms of its component neuritic β-amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangle pathologies. Additionally, we identify one new miRNA (miR-99) and four lincRNA that are associated with these traits. Many other previously reported associations of microRNA with AD are associated with the confounders quantified in our longitudinal cohort. Finally, by performing analyses integrating both miRNA and RNA sequence data from the same individuals (525 samples), we characterize the impact of AD associated miRNA on human brain expression: we show that the effects of miR-132 and miR-129-5b converge on certain genes such as EP300 and find a role for miR200 and its target genes in AD using an integrated miRNA/mRNA analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, miRNAs play a modest role in human AD, but we observe robust evidence that a small number of miRNAs are responsible for specific alterations in the cortical transcriptome that are associated with AD.},

This intrinsic heterogeneity poses one of the central challenges to predicting patient clinical outcome and the personalization of treatments. Despite progress in some individual tumor types, it is not yet possible to prospectively, accurately classify patients by expected survival. One hypothesis proposed to explain this is that the prognostic classifiers developed to date are insufficiently sensitive and specific; however it is also possible that patients are not equally easy to classify by any given biomarker. We demonstrate in a cohort of 45 AJCC stage III melanoma patients that clinico-pathologic biomarkers can identify those patients that are most likely to be misclassified by a molecular biomarker. The process of modelling the classifiability of patients was then replicated in a cohort of 49 stage II breast cancer patients and 53 stage III colon cancer patients. A multi-step procedure incorporating this information not only improved classification accuracy but also indicated the specific clinical attributes that had made classification problematic in each cohort. These findings show that, even when cohorts are of moderate size, including features that explain the patient-specific performance of a prognostic biomarker in a classification framework can improve the modelling and estimation of survival.},

Here, we propose a hypothesis driven kinase perturbation analysis (KinasePA) to annotate and visualise kinases and their substrates that are perturbed by various combinatorial effects of treatments in phosphoproteomics experiments. We demonstrate the utility of KinasePA through its application to two large-scale phosphoproteomics datasets and show its effectiveness in dissecting kinases and substrates within signalling pathways driven by unique combinations of cellular stimuli and inhibitors. We implemented and incorporated KinasePA as part of the "directPA" R package available from the comprehensive R archive network (CRAN). Furthermore, KinasePA also has an interactive web interface that can be readily applied to annotate user provided phosphoproteomics data (http://kinasepa.pengyiyang.org).},

This study used tongue twisters to test predictions of the two different models of word form encoding. Tongue twisters were constructed from 5 sets of characters that rotated pairs of initial segments or pairs of tones, or both, across format (ABAB, ABBA), and across position of the characters in four-character tongue twister strings. Fifty two native Mandarin Chinese speakers read aloud 120 tongue twisters, repeating each one six times in a row. They made a total of 3503 (2.34\%) segment errors and 1372 (.92\%) tone errors. Segment errors occurred on the onsets of the first and third characters in the ABBA but not ABAB segment-alternating tongue twisters, and on the onsets of the second and fourth characters of the tone-alternating tongue twisters. Tone errors were highest on the third and fourth characters in the tone-alternating tongue twisters. The pattern of tone errors is consistent with the claim that tone is associated to a metrical frame prior to segment encoding, while the format by position interaction found for the segment-alternating tongue twisters suggest articulatory gestures oscillate in segment production as proposed by gestural phonology.},

We leverage the information within existing micro-RNA target and pathway databases to stabilize the estimation and annotation of micro-RNA regulation making our approach suitable for datasets with small sample sizes. In addition to outputting meaningful and interpretable results, we demonstrate in a variety of datasets that the micro-RNA identified by pMim, in comparison to simpler existing approaches, are also more concordant with what is described in the literature.

Estimating changes in the overall transcription of a gene is not straightforward. Changes in overall gene transcription can easily be confounded with changes in exon usage which alter the lengths of transcripts produced by a gene. Measuring the expression of constitutive exons–xons which are consistently conserved after splicing–ffers an unbiased estimation of the overall transcription of a gene. RESULTS: We propose a clustering-based method, exClust, for estimating the exons that are consistently conserved after splicing in a given data set. These are considered as the exons which are "constitutive" in this data. The method utilises information from both annotation and the dataset of interest. The method is implemented in an openly available R function package, sydSeq. CONCLUSION: When used on two real datasets exClust includes more than three times as many reads as the standard UI method, and improves concordance with qRT-PCR data. When compared to other methods, our method is shown to produce robust estimates of overall gene transcription.},

	abstract = {The IFNL3 genotype predicts the clearance of hepatitis C virus (HCV), spontaneously and with interferon (IFN)-based therapy. The responder genotype is associated with lower expression of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) in liver biopsies from chronic hepatitis C patients. However, ISGs represent many interacting molecular pathways, and we hypothesised that the IFNL3 genotype may produce a characteristic pattern of ISG expression explaining the effect of genotype on viral clearance. For the first time, we identified an association between a cluster of ISGs, the metallothioneins (MTs) and IFNL3 genotype. Importantly, MTs were significantly upregulated (in contrast to most other ISGs) in HCV-infected liver biopsies of rs8099917 responders. An association between lower fibrosis scores and higher MT levels was demonstrated underlying clinical relevance of this association. As expected, overall ISGs were significantly downregulated in biopsies from subjects with the IFNL3 rs8099917 responder genotype (P=2.38 × 10(-7)). Peripheral blood analysis revealed paradoxical and not previously described findings with upregulation of ISGs seen in the responder genotype (P=1.00 × 10(-4)). The higher MT expression in responders may contribute to their improved viral clearance and MT-inducing agents may be useful adjuncts to therapy for HCV. Upregulation of immune cell ISGs in responders may also contribute to the IFNL3 genotype effect.},

	abstract = {AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Muscle insulin resistance, one of the earliest defects associated with type 2 diabetes, involves changes in the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt network. The relative contribution of obesity vs insulin resistance to perturbations in this pathway is poorly understood. METHODS: We used phosphospecific antibodies against targets in the Akt signalling network to study insulin action in muscle from lean, overweight/obese and type 2 diabetic individuals before and during a hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp. RESULTS: Insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation at Thr309 and Ser474 was highly correlated with whole-body insulin sensitivity. In contrast, impaired phosphorylation of Akt substrate of 160 kDa (AS160; also known as TBC1D4) was associated with adiposity, but not insulin sensitivity. Neither insulin sensitivity nor obesity was associated with defective insulin-dependent phosphorylation of forkhead box O (FOXO) transcription factor. In view of the resultant basal hyperinsulinaemia, we predicted that this selective response within the Akt pathway might lead to hyperactivation of those processes that were spared. Indeed, the expression of genes targeted by FOXO was downregulated in insulin-resistant individuals. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: These results highlight non-linearity in Akt signalling and suggest that: (1) the pathway from Akt to glucose transport is complex; and (2) pathways, particularly FOXO, that are not insulin-resistant, are likely to be hyperactivated in response to hyperinsulinaemia. This facet of Akt signalling may contribute to multiple features of the metabolic syndrome.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The cost of RNA-Seq has been decreasing over the last few years. Despite this, experiments with four or less biological replicates are still quite common. Estimating the variances of gene expression estimates becomes both a challenging and interesting problem in these situations of low replication. However, with the wealth of microarray and other publicly available gene expression data readily accessible on public repositories, these sources of information can be leveraged to make improvements in variance estimation. RESULTS: We have proposed a novel approach called Tshrink+ for inferring differential gene expression through improved modelling of the gene-wise variances. Existing methods share information between genes of similar average expression by shrinking, or moderating, the gene-wise variances to a fitted common variance. We have been able to achieve improved estimation of the common variance by using gene-wise sample variances from external experiments, as well as gene length. CONCLUSIONS: Using biological data we show that utilising additional external information can improve the modelling of the common variance and hence the calling of differentially expressed genes. These sources of additional information include gene length and gene-wise sample variances from other RNA-Seq and microarray datasets, of both related and seemingly unrelated tissue types. The results of this are promising, with our differential expression test, Tshrink+, performing favourably when compared to existing methods such as DESeq and edgeR when considering both gene ranking and sensitivity. These improved variance models could easily be implemented in both DESeq and edgeR and highlight the need for a database that offers a profile of gene variances over a range of tissue types and organisms.},

Associations with prognosis were replicated for miR-150-5p, miR-142-3p and miR-142-5p. Co-analysis of miRNA and mRNA uncovered a network associated with poor prognosis (PP) that paradoxically favoured expression of miRNAs opposing tumorigenesis. These miRNAs are likely part of an autoregulatory response to oncogenic drivers, rather than drivers themselves. Robust association of miR-150-5p and the miR-142 duplex with good prognosis and earlier stage metastatic melanoma supports their potential as biomarkers. miRNAs overexpressed in association with PP in an autoregulatory fashion will not be suitable therapeutic targets.},

	doi = {10.1093/bioinformatics/btt616},
	abstract = {MOTIVATION: With the advancement of high-throughput techniques, large-scale profiling of biological systems with multiple experimental perturbations is becoming more prevalent. Pathway analysis incorporates prior biological knowledge to analyze genes/proteins in groups in a biological context. However, the hypotheses under investigation are often confined to a 1D space (i.e. up, down, either or mixed regulation). Here, we develop direction pathway analysis (DPA), which can be applied to test hypothesis in a high-dimensional space for identifying pathways that display distinct responses across multiple perturbations. RESULTS: Our DPA approach allows for the identification of pathways that display distinct responses across multiple perturbations. To demonstrate the utility and effectiveness, we evaluated DPA under various simulated scenarios and applied it to study insulin action in adipocytes. A major action of insulin in adipocytes is to regulate the movement of proteins from the interior to the cell surface membrane. Quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomics was used to study this process on a large-scale. The combined dataset comprises four separate treatments. By applying DPA, we identified that several insulin responsive pathways in the plasma membrane trafficking are only partially dependent on the insulin-regulated kinase Akt. We subsequently validated our findings through targeted analysis of key proteins from these pathways using immunoblotting and live cell microscopy. Our results demonstrate that DPA can be applied to dissect pathway networks testing diverse hypotheses and integrating multiple experimental perturbations.

Immunophenotyping of whole peripheral blood (WPB) by flow cytometry is a rapid method to obtain large amounts of data relating to the outcomes of different transplant treatments with limited patient impact. Healthy individuals and patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) enrolled in islet transplantation were recruited and WPB was collected. 46 fluorochrome-conjugated mouse-anti-human antibodies were used (43 of 46 antibodies were titrated). BD cytometer setup and tracking beads were used to characterize and adjust for cytometer performance. Antibody cocktails were pre-mixed {\textbackslash}textless60 minutes before staining. Multicolour panels were designed based on fluorochrome brightness, antigen density, co-expression, and fluorochrome spillover into non-primary detectors in each panel on a 5 laser flow cytometer. WPB sample staining used 50–300 μl WPB for each panel and was performed within 2 hours of blood sample collection. Samples were acquired on a BD-LSRFortessa. The operating procedures, including specimen collection, antibody cocktails, staining protocol, flow-cytometer setup and data analysis, were standardized. The staining index of 43 antibodies and the spillover spreading matrix for each panel was calculated. The final concentrations for the 46 antibodies used was determined for staining of WPB samples. Absolute cell-count and 7 leukocyte profiling panels consisting of subsets and/or status of granulocytes, monocytes, dendritic, B, NK, and T cells including regulatory T cells (Tregs) and NKT were designed and established on a 5 laser BD-LSR Fortessa. 13 T1D patients, including 4 islet transplant recipients and 8 healthy controls, were evaluated. The ability to reproducibly measure immune subsets and immune-profiles of islet transplant patients up to 18 months post transplantation has been established as a tool to measure immune cell reconstitution after transplantation.},

Applying this approach to two largest brain eQTL datasets (n = 1,100), we show that LVs and GxE eQTLs in one dataset replicate well in the other dataset. Combining the two samples via meta-analysis, 895 GxE eQTLs are identified. On average, GxE effect explains an additional ∼4\% variation in expression of each gene that displays a GxE effect. Ten of these 52 genes are associated with cell-type-specific eQTLs, and the remaining genes are multi-functional. Furthermore, after substituting LVs with expression of transcription factors (TF), we found 91 TF-specific eQTLs, which demonstrates an important use of our brain GxE eQTLs.},

While the clinical relevance of MOG Ab detection is becoming increasingly clear as therapeutic and prognostic differences from multiple sclerosis are acknowledged, an in-depth characterization of human MOG Ab is required to answer key challenges in patient diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis. Herein, we investigated the epitope, binding sensitivity, and affinity of MOG Ab in a cohort of 139 and 148 MOG antibody-seropositive children and adults (n = 287 patients at baseline, 130 longitudinal samples, and 22 cerebrospinal fluid samples). MOG extracellular domain was also immobilized to determine the affinity of MOG Ab. MOG Ab response was of immunoglobulin G1 isotype, and was of peripheral rather than intrathecal origin. High affinity MOG Ab were detected in 15\% paediatric and 18\% adult sera. More than 75\% of paediatric and adult MOG Ab targeted a dominant extracellular antigenic region around Proline42. MOG Ab titers fluctuated over the progression of disease, but affinity and reactivity to Proline42 remained stable. Adults with a relapsing course intrinsically presented with a reduced immunoreactivity to Proline42 and had a more diverse MOG Ab response, a feature that may be harnessed for predicting relapse. Higher titers of MOG Ab were observed in more severe phenotypes and during active disease, supporting the pathogenic role of MOG Ab. Loss of MOG Ab seropositivity was observed upon conformational changes to MOG, and this greatly impacted the sensitivity of the detection of relapsing disorders, largely considered as more severe. Careful consideration of the binding characteristics of autoantigens should be taken into account when detecting disease-relevant autoantibodies.},

	abstract = {Single-cell genomics has transformed our ability to examine cell fate choice. Examining cells along a computationally ordered ‘pseudotime’ offers the potential to unpick subtle changes in variability and covariation among key genes. We describe an approach, scHOT—single-cell higher-order testing—which provides a flexible and statistically robust framework for identifying changes in higher-order interactions among genes. scHOT can be applied for cells along a continuous trajectory or across space and accommodates various higher-order measurements including variability or correlation. We demonstrate the use of scHOT by studying coordinated changes in higher-order interactions during embryonic development of the mouse liver. Additionally, scHOT identifies subtle changes in gene–gene correlations across space using spatially resolved transcriptomics data from the mouse olfactory bulb. scHOT meaningfully adds to first-order differential expression testing and provides a framework for interrogating higher-order interactions using single-cell data.},

	abstract = {Objectives Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is known to have a significant impact on immune recovery post-allogeneic haemopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). Adoptive therapy with donor-derived or third-party virus-specific T cells (VST) can restore CMV immunity leading to clinical benefit in prevention and treatment of post-HSCT infection. We developed a mass cytometry approach to study natural immune recovery post-HSCT and assess the mechanisms underlying the clinical benefits observed in recipients of VST. Methods A mass cytometry panel of 38 antibodies was utilised for global immune assessment (72 canonical innate and adaptive immune subsets) in HSCT recipients undergoing natural post-HSCT recovery (n = 13) and HSCT recipients who received third-party donor-derived CMV-VST as salvage for unresponsive CMV reactivation (n = 8). Results Mass cytometry identified distinct immune signatures associated with CMV characterised by a predominance of innate cells (monocytes and NK) seen early and an adaptive signature with activated CD8+ T cells seen later. All CMV-VST recipients had failed standard antiviral pharmacotherapy as a criterion for trial involvement; 5/8 had failed to develop the adaptive immune signature by study enrolment despite significant CMV antigen exposure. Of these, VST administration resulted in development of the adaptive signature in association with CMV control in three patients. Failure to respond to CMV-VST in one patient was associated with persistent absence of the adaptive immune signature. Conclusion The clinical benefit of CMV-VST may be mediated by the recovery of an adaptive immune signature characterised by activated CD8+ T cells.},

Recent studies have shown that deconvolution algorithms can be applied to computationally estimate cell-type proportions from gene expression data of bulk blood samples, but their performance when applied to brain tissue is unclear. Here, we have generated an immunohistochemistry (IHC) dataset for five major cell-types from brain tissue of 70 individuals, who also have bulk cortical gene expression data. With the IHC data as the benchmark, this resource enables quantitative assessment of deconvolution algorithms for brain tissue. We apply existing deconvolution algorithms to brain tissue by using marker sets derived from human brain single cell and cell-sorted RNA-seq data. We show that these algorithms can indeed produce informative estimates of constituent cell-type proportions. In fact, neuronal subpopulation can also be estimated from bulk brain tissue samples. Further, we show that including the cell-type proportion estimates as confounding factors is important for reducing false associations between Alzheimer’s disease phenotypes and gene expression. Lastly, we demonstrate that using more accurate marker sets can substantially improve statistical power in detecting cell-type specific expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs).},

Here, using a transcriptional network map of the human frontal cortex, we identify five modules of co-expressed genes related to microglia and assess their role in the neuropathologic features of AD in 540 subjects from two cohort studies of brain aging. Two of these transcriptional programs—modules 113 and 114—relate to the accumulation of β-amyloid, while module 5 relates to tau pathology. We replicate these associations in brain epigenomic data and in two independent datasets. In terms of tau, we propose that module 5, a marker of activated microglia, may lead to tau accumulation and subsequent cognitive decline. We validate our model further by showing that three representative module 5 genes (ACADVL, TRABD, and VASP) encode proteins that are upregulated in activated microglia in AD.},

Additional early cortical changes in AD include neuroinflammation and elevated iron levels. Activation of the innate immune system in the brain is a neuroprotective response to infection; however, persistent neuroinflammation is linked to AD neuropathology by uncertain mechanisms. Non-parametric machine learning analysis on transcriptomic data from a large neuropathologically characterised patient cohort revealed the acute phase protein lactoferrin (Lf) as the key predictor of amyloid pathology. In vitro studies showed that an interaction between APP and the iron-bound form of Lf secreted from activated microglia diverted neuronal APP endocytosis from the canonical clathrin-dependent pathway to one requiring ADP ribosylation factor 6 trafficking. By rerouting APP recycling to the Rab11-positive compartment for amyloidogenic processing, Lf dramatically increased neuronal Aβ production. Lf emerges as a novel pharmacological target for AD that not only modulates APP processing but provides a link between Aβ production, neuroinflammation and iron dysregulation.},

	abstract = {Although HIV infection inhibits interferon responses in its target cells in vitro, interferon signatures can be detected in vivo soon after sexual transmission, mainly attributed to plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs). In this study, we examined the physiological contributions of pDCs to early HIV acquisition using coculture models of pDCs with myeloid DCs, macrophages and the resting central, transitional and effector memory CD4 T cell subsets. pDCs impacted infection in a cell-specific manner. In myeloid cells, HIV infection was decreased via antiviral effects, cell maturation and downregulation of CCR5 expression. In contrast, in resting memory CD4 T cells, pDCs induced a subset-specific increase in intracellular HIV p24 protein expression without any activation or increase in CCR5 expression, as measured by flow cytometry. This increase was due to reactivation rather than enhanced viral spread, as blocking HIV entry via CCR5 did not alter the increased intracellular p24 expression. Furthermore, the load and proportion of cells expressing HIV DNA were restricted in the presence of pDCs while reverse transcriptase and p24 ELISA assays showed no increase in particle associated reverse transcriptase or extracellular p24 production. In addition, pDCs also markedly induced the expression of CD69 on infected CD4 T cells and other markers of CD4 T cell tissue retention. These phenotypic changes showed marked parallels with resident memory CD4 T cells isolated from anogenital tissue using enzymatic digestion. Production of IFNα by pDCs was the main driving factor for all these results. Thus, pDCs may reduce HIV spread during initial mucosal acquisition by inhibiting replication in myeloid cells while reactivating latent virus in resting memory CD4 T cells and retaining them for immune clearance.},

In addition to Langerhans cells (LCs), we recently described a second epidermal MNP population, Epi-cDC2s, in human anogenital epidermis that is closely related to dermal conventional dendritic cells type 2 (cDC2) and can be preferentially infected by HIV. Here we show that in epidermal explants topically infected with herpes simplex virus (HSV-1), both LCs and Epi-cDC2s interact with HSV-1 particles and infected keratinocytes. Isolated Epi-cDC2s support higher levels of infection than LCs in vitro, inhibited by acyclovir, but both MNP subtypes express similar levels of the HSV entry receptors nectin-1 and HVEM, and show similar levels of initial uptake. Using inhibitors of endosomal acidification, actin and cholesterol, we found that HSV-1 utilises different entry pathways in each cell type. HSV-1 predominantly infects LCs, and monocyte-derived MNPs, via a pH-dependent pathway. In contrast, Epi-cDC2s are mainly infected via a pH-independent pathway which may contribute to the enhanced infection of Epi-cDC2s. Both cells underwent apoptosis suggesting that Epi-cDC2s may follow the same dermal migration and uptake by dermal MNPs that we have previously shown for LCs. Thus, we hypothesize that the uptake of HSV and infection of Epi-cDC2s will stimulate immune responses via a different pathway to LCs, which in future may help guide HSV vaccine development and adjuvant targeting.},

At post-mortem there are cortical regions that range from mildly to severely affected by tau pathology and neuronal loss. A comparison of the molecular signatures of these differentially affected areas within cases and between cases and controls may allow the temporal modelling of disease progression. Here we used RNA sequencing to explore differential gene expression in the mildly affected primary visual cortex and moderately affected precuneus of ten age-, gender- and RNA quality-matched post-mortem brains from AD patients and healthy controls. The two regions in AD cases had similar transcriptomic signatures but there were broader abnormalities in the precuneus consistent with the greater tau load. Both regions were characterised by upregulation of immune-related genes such as those encoding triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 and membrane spanning 4-domains A6A and milder changes in insulin/IGF1 signalling. The precuneus in AD was also characterised by changes in vesicle secretion and downregulation of the interneuronal subtype marker, somatostatin. The ‘early’ AD transcriptome is characterised by perturbations in synaptic vesicle secretion on a background of neuroimmune dysfunction. In particular, the synaptic deficits that characterise AD may begin with the somatostatin division of inhibitory neurotransmission.},

Current approaches to mitigate autofluorescence in tissue are lab-based and involve either chemical treatment of sections or specialized instrumentation and software to ‘unmix’ autofluorescent signals. Importantly, these approaches are pre-emptive and there are currently no methods to deal with autofluorescence in acquired fluorescence microscopy images.To address this, we developed Autofluorescence Identifier (AFid). AFid identifies autofluorescent pixels as discrete objects in multi-channel images post-acquisition. These objects can then be tagged for exclusion from downstream analysis. We validated AFid using images of FFPE human colorectal tissue stained for common immune markers. Further, we demonstrate its utility for image analysis where its implementation allows the accurate measurement of HIV–Dendritic cell interactions in a colorectal explant model of HIV transmission. Therefore, AFid represents a major leap forward in the extraction of useful data from images plagued by autofluorescence by offering an approach that is easily incorporated into existing workflows and that can be used with various samples, staining panels and image acquisition methods. We have implemented AFid in ImageJ, Matlab and R to accommodate the diverse image analysis community.AFid software is available at https://ellispatrick.github.io/AFid.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

Strategies that modify DC function provide new therapeutic opportunities in autoimmune diseases and transplantation.

The classical phenotypic characterization of tolDC is limited to cell-surface marker expression and anti-inflammatory cytokine production, although these are not specific. TolDC may be better defined using gene signatures, but there is no consensus definition regarding genotypic markers. We address this shortcoming by analyzing available transcriptomic data to yield an independent set of differentially expressed genes that characterize human tolDC. We validate this transcriptomic signature and also explore gene differences according to the method of tolDC generation. As well as establishing a novel characterization of tolDC, we interrogated its translational utility in vivo, demonstrating this geneset was enriched in the liver, a known tolerogenic organ.

	abstract = {Dementia affects millions of individuals worldwide, yet there are no effective treatments. Alzheimer's disease, the most common form of dementia, is characterized by amyloid and tau pathology with amyloid accumulation thought to precipitate tau pathology, neurodegeneration, and dementia. The Religious Orders Study and Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP) cohort is a unique resource with quantitative pathology from multiple brain regions, RNA sequencing, and longitudinal cognitive data. Our previous work applying machine learning to the RNA sequencing data identified lactoferrin (LTF) as the gene most predictive of amyloid accumulation with a potential amyloidogenic mechanism identified in vitro and with cell-culture models. In the present study, we examined which pathologies and genes were related to cognitive status (dementia, mild impairment, and no cognitive impairment) and rate of cognitive decline. Tau load in the anterior cingulate and ADAMTS2, encoding a metallopeptidase, were the respective regional pathology and gene most associated with cognitive decline, while PRTN3, encoding a serine protease, was the key protective feature. ADAMTS2, but not PRTN3, was related to amyloid and tau load in the previous study while LTF was not related to cognitive decline here. These findings confirm a general relationship between tau pathology and dementia, show the specific importance of tau pathology in the anterior cingulate cortex and identify ADAMTS2 as a potential target for slowing cognitive decline.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: The tumour immune microenvironment impacts the biological behaviour of the tumour but its effect on clinical outcomes in head and neck cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas (HNcSCC) is largely unknown. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We compared the immune milieu of high-risk HNcSCC that never progressed to metastasis with those that metastasised using multi-parameter imaging mass cytometry. The cohort included both immunosuppressed patients (IS) and patients with an absence of clinical immune-suppression (ACIS). Spatial analyses were used to identify cellular interactions that were associated with tumour behaviour. RESULTS: Non-progressing primary HNcSCC were characterised by higher CD8+ and CD4+ T cell responses, including numerically increased Regulatory T cells. By contrast, primary lesions from HNcSCC patients who progressed were largely devoid of T cells with lower numbers of innate immune cells and increased expression of checkpoint receptors and in the metastatic lesions were characterised by an accumulation of B cells. Spatial analysis reveals multiple cellular interactions associated with non-progressing primary tumours that were distinct in primary tumours of disease progressing patients. Cellular regional analysis of the tumour microenvironment also shows squamous cell-enriched tumour regions associated with primary non-progressing tumours. CONCLUSIONS: Effective responses from both CD8+ and CD4+ T cells in the tumour microenvironment are essential for immune control of primary HNcSCC. Our findings indicate that the early events that shape the immune responses in primary tumours dictate progression and disease outcomes in HNcSCC.},

RESULTS: Here, we present scFeatures, an approach that creates interpretable cellular and molecular representations of single-cell and spatial data at the sample level.

However, current approaches are often location-specific due to the inherent differences between platforms and across multiple centres, thus limiting the transferability of molecular signatures. We present Cross-Platform Omics Prediction (CPOP), a penalised regression model that can use omics data to predict patient outcomes in a platform-independent manner and across time and experiments. CPOP improves on the traditional prediction framework of using gene-based features by selecting ratio-based features with similar estimated effect sizes. These components gave CPOP the ability to have a stable performance across datasets of similar biology, minimising the effect of technical noise often generated by omics platforms. We present a comprehensive evaluation using melanoma transcriptomics data to demonstrate its potential to be used as a critical part of a clinical screening framework for precision medicine.

	abstract = {Virus-specific T-cells (VSTs) from third-party donors mediate short- and long-term antiviral effects in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients with relapsed or refractory viral infections. We investigated early administration of third-party VSTs, together with antiviral therapy in patients requiring treatment for first cytomegalovirus (CMV) or Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. Thirty HSCT patients were treated with 1 to 4 VST infusions (2 × 107 cells/m2; CMV n=27, EBV n=3) at a median of 4 days after initiation of antiviral treatment. The overall viral response rate was 100\%, with a complete response (CR) rate of 94\%. Of the 28 patients who achieved a CR, 23 remained virus PCR negative (n=9) or below quantitation limit (n=14) for the duration of follow-up. Four patients had brief episodes of quantifiable reactivation not requiring additional therapy, and one required a second infusion after initial CR, remaining PCR negative thereafter. All 3 patients treated for EBV post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder achieved sustained CR. Rates of aGVHD and cGVHD after infusion were 13\% and 23\%, respectively. There were no serious infusion-related adverse events. VST infusion was associated with rapid recovery of CD8+CD45RA-CD62L- and a slower recovery of CD4+CD45RA-CD62L- effector memory T-cells; CMV-specific T-cells comprised up to 13\% of CD8+ cells. At 1 year post-transplant, non-relapse mortality was 10\%, cumulative incidence of relapse was 7\%, overall survival was 88\% and 25 of 27 patients had ECOG status of 0 or 1. Early administration of third-party VSTs in conjunction with antiviral treatment appears safe and leads to excellent viral control and clinical outcomes.

By combining RNAscope, cyclic immunofluorescence, and image analysis tools, we quantify HIV transmission signatures in intact human colorectal explants within 2 h of topical exposure. We map HIV enrichment to mucosal dendritic cells (DCs) and submucosal macrophages, but not CD4+ T cells, the primary targets of downstream infection. HIV+ DCs accumulate near and within lymphoid aggregates, which act as early sanctuaries of high viral titers while facilitating HIV passage to the submucosa. Finally, HIV entry induces recruitment and clustering of target cells, facilitating DC- and macrophage-mediated HIV transfer and enhanced infection of CD4+ T cells. These data demonstrate a rapid response to HIV structured to maximize the likelihood of mucosal infection and provide a framework for in situ studies of host-pathogen interactions and immune-mediated pathologies.},

This allows the complex cellular architecture and environment of diseased tissue to be explored. While spatial analysis techniques have revealed how cell-cell interactions are important within the disease pathology, there remains a gap in exploring changes in these interactions within the disease process. Specifically, there are currently few established methods for performing inference on cell-type co-localization changes across images, hindering an understanding of how cellular environments change with a disease pathology.
RESULTS: We have developed the spicyR R package to perform inference on changes in the spatial co-localization of types across groups of images. Application to simulated data demonstrates a high sensitivity and specificity. We the utility of spicyR by applying it to a type 1 diabetes imaging mass cytometry dataset, revealing changes in cellular associations that were relevant to the disease progression. Ultimately, spicyR allows changes in cellular environments to be explored under different pathologies or disease states.

	abstract = {The spatial architecture of the tumour microenvironment and phenotypic heterogeneity of tumour cells have been shown to be associated with cancer prognosis and clinical outcomes, including survival. Recent advances in highly multiplexed imaging, including imaging mass cytometry (IMC), capture spatially resolved, high-dimensional maps that quantify dozens of disease-relevant biomarkers at single-cell resolution, that contain potential to inform patient-specific prognosis. Existing automated methods for predicting survival, on the other hand, typically do not leverage spatial phenotype information captured at the single-cell level. Furthermore, there is no end-to-end method designed to leverage the rich information in whole IMC images and all marker channels, and aggregate this information with clinical data in a complementary manner to predict survival with enhanced accuracy. To that end, we present a deep multimodal graph-based network (DMGN) with two modules: (1) a multimodal graph-based module that considers relationships between spatial phenotype information in all image regions and all clinical variables adaptively, and (2) a clinical embedding module that automatically generates embeddings specialised for each clinical variable to enhance multimodal aggregation. We demonstrate that our modules are consistently effective at improving survival prediction performance using two public breast cancer datasets, and that our new approach can outperform state-of-the-art methods in survival prediction.},

While granulomas are pathologically diverse, their tissue-wide heterogeneity has not been spatially resolved at the single-cell level in human tissues. By spatially mapping individual immune cells in every lesion across entire tissue sections, we report that in addition to necrotizing granulomas, the human TB lung contains abundant non-necrotizing leukocyte aggregates surrounding areas of necrotizing tissue. These cellular lesions were more diverse in composition than necrotizing lesions and could be stratified into four general classes based on cellular composition and spatial distribution of B cells and macrophages. The cellular composition of non-necrotizing structures also correlates with their proximity to necrotizing lesions, indicating these are foci of distinct immune reactions adjacent to necrotizing granulomas. Together, we show that during TB, diseased lung tissue develops a histopathological superstructure comprising at least four different types of non-necrotizing cellular aggregates organized as satellites of necrotizing granulomas.},
